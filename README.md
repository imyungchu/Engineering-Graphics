# 工程圖學 Engineering Graphics

###### tags: `109下` `二下必修` `AutoCAD`

> The objectives of the course are to learn the principles of graphic expression, the fundamentals of manual drafting drawing and sketching, and the application of such fundamentals to computer-aided design and drafting (CAD). at the end of this semester, students should be able to:
>1. Read the engineering graphics
>2. Draw the mechanical multiview drawing
>3. Draw the mechanical isometric drawing
>4. Draw the mechanical sectional drawing
>5. Draw the mechanical aux. drawing
>6. Apply ![](https://i.imgur.com/Q4xmRy1.png) AutoCAD to draw mechanical drawing.



## :memo: Final project of the course

### Step 1: Choose object for the project 

- [x] Must have at least six parts and one inclined plane
- [x] Send a combination diagram to E3 ==figure 1==
- [x] Must be unique from other classmate(first upload)

==figure 1== . Product combination diagram

### Step 2: Parts description and Exploded Views

We need to descript the parts seperately(零件說明)==figure 2== and draw the exploded views (爆炸圖)==figure 3== as to clarify what to draw in AutoCAD later.
